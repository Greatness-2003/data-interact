    <p>This page displays three interactive visualizations that explore the relationship between voting habits, education, income, and voter turnout in Virginia. 
        The first plot is a parallel categories plot that shows the distribution of voting habits by education and income. The second plot is a bubble plot that 
        shows the relationship between voter turnout, absentee ballots, and total registered voters by locality. 
        The third plot is a choropleth map that shows the percentage of voter turnout in the Virginia 2022 general election by locality.</p>
   <h2>Relationship Between Voting Habits, Education, And Income Levels</h2> 
   <h3 class="center">Parallel Categories Plot</h3>
   <iframe src="categories.htm" width="100%" height="75%" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
   <p>All voting patterns have values in all income and education categories. Starting with voters who rarely vote, 
    the bulk of them have incomes lower than $40k. That number reduces as income increases, becoming very little at over $125k. 
    Most of them (rare voters) also have a highschool or less education, and much less and very similar number of them have some
    college or graduate experience.</p>
    <p>As for sporadic voters, they seem to be all over the place. Most voters (over 2500) fall into this category. In direct contrast
    to rare voters, their numbers increase in positive correlation to income, with most sporadic voters having an income of over $125k. 
    As for education, most sporadic voters graduated from college, with the numbers having been to highschool and some college pretty much the same, although highschool having more.</p>
    <p>Finally, for voters who always vote, over a 1000 of the 1811 of them earn $75k and above: the most of them earn between $75-125k, and the next most earn over $125k. The remaining 
    few are shared almost equally between earning $75-125k and below $75k. As for their education, 
    most of them have graduated from college, with some college coming in a not so close 2nd. About a quarter of them attended highschool of less.

   <h2>Comparison of Voter Turnout And Absentee Voters in Virginia Elections</h2>
   <h3 class="center">Bubble Plot</h3>
   <iframe src="bubble.htm" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"></iframe>
   <p>From the plot, for all years shown, counties and cities in the Northern region (pink bubbles) are always much larger than others, 
    indicating that they have a much higher number of registered voters every year than other regions. A year that looks particularly 
    different from others is 2020.  The bubbles on this plot are arranged in an almost straight line. The percent turnout values are all 
    around 80% while the percent absentee increases, going up to the highest value of the y-axis. Basically, the % turnout stays mostly 
    constant for all counties and cities while the % absentee increases. This is probably due to covid-19 lockdown when most people were 
    stuck at home and probably didnâ€™t go out to vote.

   <h2>Distribution of Voter Turnout in 2022 Virginia Elections</h2>
   <h3 class="center">Choropleth Map</h3>
   <iframe src="map.htm" width="100%" height="75%" frameborder="0"></iframe>
   <p>This map was made using a subset of the data for the 2nd image. On the map, all of the darker shades (>56%) are spread across the North and northeastern counties and cities of Virginia, 
    while the lighter colors are mostly in the south and southwestern parts. However there are certain counties/cities with lighter 
    shades spread across the map, not only in the south, unlike the ones with higher percentages that are clustered in the upper and 
    right part of the part. This indicates that there is generally higher voter turnout in northern and eastern Virginia, and lower 
    turnout in the southwestern areas of Virginia.
